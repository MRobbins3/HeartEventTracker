<p>
Heavy inspriation for this mod comes from cdaragorn's [Ui-Info-Suite mod](https://github.com/cdaragorn/Ui-Info-Suite),
which draws more accurate friendship hearts, although nothing was directly copied from there.

<p>
Most of the text for hints and descriptions was taken directly from the [Stardew Valley wiki](https://stardewvalleywiki.com). For any 
missing descriptions and hints (especially ones for letters or follow-up cutscenes), I've done my best to paraphrase.

This mod was designed with translations in mind, but I need help tranlating it. If you are fluent in a missing language 
(Chinese, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, or Turkish) please feel free to 
reach out so we can make this mod more accessible, together.
