    "edge-cases.very-long-text": "This is just an example of some very long translation text that could appear in some mod translation files, presumably for the mods to use in places where they need very long translation strings. One thing to keep in mind is that there's no real limit to the length that translation strings can reach, but we probably don't need the entire translation string added to the method's XML docs for IntelliSense. Instead we can just truncate at some reasonable text length, say 500 characters right about here.",

(This is just like the arcade version in The Stardrop Saloon, except that Abigail plays a second character and actively helps you). When you finish the level, she thanks you and the cutscene ends. If you fail, however, she will still thank you for trying.",

    "Abigail.8Hearts2FullDesc": "When you arrive, Abigail shows you her spirit board. It reveals a message that indicates she's starting to develop feelings for you. She gets embarrassed and rushes you out of her room. Regardless of how you entered the store, you will end up outside.",
