One thing to keep in mind is that there's no real limit to the length that translation strings can reach, but we probably don't need the entire translation string added to the method's XML docs for IntelliSense. Instead we can just truncate at some reasonable text length, say 500 characters right about here.",

    "Abigail.2HeartsFullDesc": "You enter Abigail's room and watch her get angry about a videogame. She asks for your help, and you play the console version of Journey of the Prairie King together. (This is just like the arcade version in The Stardrop Saloon, except that Abigail plays a second character and actively helps you). When you finish the level, she thanks you and the cutscene ends. If you fail, however, she will still thank you for trying."
